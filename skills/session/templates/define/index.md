## Contents

<!-- One line and a link per sub-doc that exists. Delete lines for files this tier doesn't create. -->
- [Requirements](requirements.md): the `REQ-*` table and any deferred requirements
- [Framing](framing.md): problem checks, anchor verdict and overlaps (short, full)
- [Problem](problem.md): need, stakeholders, evidence and success outcomes (short, full)
- [Quality](quality.md): ISO/IEC 25010:2023 coverage, NFR measures, assumptions and dependencies (full)
- [Diagrams](diagrams.md): the Feature diagrams (full, or when an optional diagram is chosen)

## Framing

- **Tier:** {full | short | skip}: {one-line reason, drawn from the issue and the size of the work}
- **Verdict:** {aligns | extends} with the project anchor. See [framing.md](framing.md). <!-- short and full only; delete at skip -->

## Problem statement

<!-- Skip: one paragraph. What's wrong, for whom, and why it matters, in 2-4 sentences, with no design or solution talk. -->
<!-- Short and full: a short summary naming the NEED-nn and OUT-nn IDs, linking to problem.md, without repeating their rows. -->
{Summary.} Needs: {NEED-01, …}. Outcomes: {OUT-01, …}. See [problem.md](problem.md).

## Scope

{What this session covers. A scope item that a set of REQ rows states in full shrinks to one line linking to those rows in requirements.md.}

### Non-goals

- {Something explicitly out of scope, and where it's tracked if it's real future work}

## Constraints

- {A limit any solution must satisfy}

## Open questions

{Anything not yet resolved, including any requirement or edge case whose expected result is unknown. If none: "All questions resolved."}
